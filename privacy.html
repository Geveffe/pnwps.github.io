          <h2>1. Overview</h2>
          <p>
            PNWPS Poker Results (“the app”) is a private iOS application used by the PNWPS
            home poker league to track seasons, game results, and standings.
            The app uses Google Sign-In and the Google Sheets API to store and retrieve league data
            from a single, dedicated spreadsheet owned by the league organizer.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-section">
          <h2>2. Information we collect</h2>
          <p>The app itself collects and processes the following types of information:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Google account information</strong>: When you sign in with Google,
              Google provides your basic profile information (such as your name and email address)
              to the app, as allowed by your consent.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>League data</strong>: Player names, game dates, placements, chip totals,
              and other information you enter through the app, which is stored in the league’s
              Google Sheets document.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The app does not collect sensitive personal information such as payment details,
            government IDs, or precise location.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-section">
          <h2>3. How we use your information</h2>
          <p>We use the information described above only to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Authenticate you via your Google account.</li>
            <li>Read and write league data in the single configured Google Sheets document.</li>
            <li>Display seasons, game results, and the leaderboard within the app.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We do not sell your data, and we do not use it for advertising or marketing.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-section">
          <h2>4. Google APIs and limited use</h2>
          <p>
            PNWPS Poker Results uses Google Sign-In and the Google Sheets API. Our use and
            transfer of information received from Google APIs adheres to the
            <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
              Google API Services User Data Policy
            </a>, including the Limited Use requirements.
          </p>
          <p>In practice, this means:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The app only requests the scopes needed to read and write to Google Sheets.</li>
            <li>The app only accesses one specific spreadsheet configured by the league organizer.</li>
            <li>We do not use your Google data for advertising or to build marketing profiles.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-section">
          <h2>5. Data storage and security</h2>
          <p>
            League data is stored in a single Google Sheets document in the organizer’s Google
            account. Access to that document is managed through Google’s sharing and permission
            settings. We recommend that only trusted league members be granted access.
          </p>
          <p>
            While we take reasonable steps to protect the data (for example, using secure
            connections to Google APIs), no system can be guaranteed 100% secure.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-section">
          <h2>6. Data retention</h2>
          <p>
            Game and season history is typically retained for as long as the league organizer
            chooses to keep the Google Sheets document. If you want your name removed from past
            seasons or games, please contact the organizer so the sheet can be edited accordingly.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-section">
          <h2>7. Third-party services</h2>
          <p>
            The app relies on Google services for authentication and data storage. Your use of
            the app also means you are subject to Google’s own terms and privacy policies.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-section">
          <h2>8. Children’s privacy</h2>
          <p>
            The app is intended for adult participants of a private home poker league.
            It is not designed for or marketed to children under 13.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-section">
          <h2>9. Changes to this policy</h2>
          <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the
            “Last updated” date at the top of this page. Continued use of the app after changes
            are posted constitutes your acceptance of the revised policy.
          </p>

          <h2>10. Contact</h2>
