          <h2>1. Agreement to terms</h2>
          <p>
            By using the PNWPS Poker Results app (“the app”), you agree to be bound by these Terms
            of Service. If you do not agree to these terms, do not use the app.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-section">
          <h2>2. Purpose of the app</h2>
          <p>
            The app is designed for a private home poker league to track seasons, games, and
            standings. It is not a real-money gambling platform, and it does not handle wagers,
            deposits, or payouts of any kind.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-section">
          <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
          <p>
            The app is intended for adult members of the PNWPS poker league who have been given
            access by the organizer. By using the app, you represent that you are legally allowed
            to participate in your local home poker games and that you are not prohibited from
            using such tools by any applicable laws.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-section">
          <h2>4. Google account and access</h2>
          <p>
            The app uses Google Sign-In to authenticate users and the Google Sheets API to read
            and write league data. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your
            Google account and for any actions taken using your account within the app.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-section">
          <h2>5. League data</h2>
          <p>
            Game results, player names, and other league information recorded through the app are
            stored in a single Google Sheets document. The league organizer controls access to this
            document. By using the app, you understand that your name and game results may be
            visible to other league members with access to that sheet.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-section">
          <h2>6. No guarantees and limitation of liability</h2>
          <p>
            The app is provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis. We do not guarantee that
            the app will be error-free, available at all times, or that data will never be lost.
          </p>
          <p>
            To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental,
            special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the app, including
            but not limited to loss of data or league standings.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="legal-section">
          <h2>7. Acceptable use</h2>
          <p>You agree not to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Use the app for any unlawful purpose.</li>
            <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the underlying Google Sheets document.</li>
            <li>Reverse engineer, interfere with, or disrupt the operation of the app.</li>

          <h2>8. Changes to the app or these terms</h2>
          <p>
            We may modify or discontinue the app at any time. We may also update these Terms of
            Service from time to time. When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date at the
            top of this page. Continued use of the app after changes are posted constitutes your
            acceptance of the revised terms.
